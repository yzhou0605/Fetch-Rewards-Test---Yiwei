--Q2 and Q3 are answered using T-SQL in the MS SQL Server
--SECOND QUESTION
create database Bar
select * from bar.dbo.brands
select * from bar.dbo.users
select * from bar.dbo.receipts

--Q: Which brand has the most spend among users who were created within the past 6 months?

-- I assume the metric for the date column is millisecond and convert into day (there are 86410958.9041065425 milliseconds in a day).
-- I assume the latest user account is created TODAY and subselected all the user whose accounts were created 180 days before the latest account.
-- Null brands are automatically removed and not considered in this question.

sum(totalSpent) as spend

--A: Pepsi has the most spend among users who were created within the past 6 months

--Q: Which brand has the most transactions among users who were created within the past 6 months?

select b.name, count(r.ID) as trans_cnt

--A: Pepsi has the most transactions among users who were created within the past 6 months

--Q: When considering average spend from receipts with 'rewardsReceiptStatus’ of ‘Accepted’ or ‘Rejected’, which is greater?
--There is no "Accepted" as receipt status - I used "Finished" in lieu of that
select * from
(select avg(totalSpent) as Spend_Accepted from bar.dbo.receipts r
where upper(rewardsReceiptStatus) = 'FINISHED') f,
(select avg(totalSpent) as Spend_Rejected from bar.dbo.receipts r
where upper(rewardsReceiptStatus) = 'REJECTED') r

--A: Average spend is greater for the receipts with "Finished" status

--Q: When considering total number of items purchased from receipts with 
--'rewardsReceiptStatus’ of ‘Accepted’ or ‘Rejected’, which is greater?
select * from
(select count(*) as Items_Accepted from bar.dbo.receipts r
where upper(rewardsReceiptStatus) = 'FINISHED') f,
(select count(*) as Items_Rejected from bar.dbo.receipts r
where upper(rewardsReceiptStatus) = 'REJECTED') r

--A: Total number of items accepted is higher


--THIRD QUESTION
--There are large number of NULL values in the joining fields including brandCode for the receipts table.
--There are also null values in the primary key (receipt ID) and foreign key (user ID) in the receipt table which undermines data quality while referencing data.
--The interpretation of date columns is subjective to the user (e.g. converting milli-esconds to days in my solution)
SELECT id_oid, 'missing_brand' AS reason
FROM bar.dbo.brands
WHERE brandCode IS NULL

--Duplicate user ID that violates the primary key constraint
SELECT id_oid, 'duplicate_id' AS reason
FROM (
    SELECT id_oid, count(id_oid) AS count
    FROM bar.dbo.users
    GROUP BY id_oid
) h
WHERE count > 1
